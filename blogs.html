            <h2>Global Scope VS Block Scope</h2>
            <p><span>Scope:</span> Visibility or Accessibility of a variable.</p>
            <p>
                <span>Global Scope:</span> If a variable is declared outside all functions
                or curly braces ({}), it is said to be defined in the global scope.
                Once youâ€™ve declared a global variable, you can use that variable
                anywhere in your code, even in functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Block Scope:</span> When you declare a variable with const or let
                within a curly brace ({}), you can access this variable only within
                that curly brace.
            </p>

            <h2>Local Storage VS Session Storage</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Session Storage:</span> The sessionStorage object stores data only
                for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage
                will be deleted when the browser is closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Local Storage:</span> Unlike sessionStorage localStorage continues
                to store data after the browser is closed. It means that data stored
                in localStorage does not expire.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Event Loop?</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Event Loop:</span> It's a fundamental piece of the JavaScript engine
                that always monitor call stack, task queue and microtask queue. If
                the call stack is empty it puts callback function in call stact from
                task queues.

            <h2>When do we get <code>undefined</code> in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                <span>1. When value is not defined.</span> <br>
                <span>2. When a function does not return anything it return
                    undefined.</span>
                <br>
                <span>3. When you try to access a property of an object that does not
                    exist.</span>
